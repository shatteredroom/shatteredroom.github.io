	<div>	<p>This is a journalling of what goes on in the sessions, starting 11/10/2018</p>
		<h3>11/10/2018</h3>
			<p>Today, Ailis shattered an illusionary wall. The party has begun a descent into the catacombs. <br> 
				The party then got wildly distracted and proceeded to order Hoagie's.</p>
			<p> The party returned from Hoagie's to resume the campaign <br>
				Cecilia and Veilfour slipped through the closing door undetected, but Jordmund got caught by his fingers and then flung open the door in anger and pain. <br>
				He subdued the ghost closing the door, and the king approached after being lured out by an illusionary sword created by Ailis. <br>
				While the door was left wide open, Ailis went through the join Cecilia and Veilfour. <br>
				Jormund, now unclocked by his brash actions, tried to convince the king to drop his weapon. <br>
				The attempt failed, and combat ensued. <br>
				"What is a man, a god, in the face of JUSTICE??" shouted Jormund, as he charged in.<br>
				The heroes emerged with a flawless victory after a long battle, and the heroes received their new loot with great joy. <br>
			</p>
			<p> With that victory, the heroes then set off to talk to Morgana.
		<h3>12/1/2018</h3>
			<p> Nicholas has had a match light on its own due to a bizarre rube goldberg machine, but nobody in the party is able to see the contraption he has described.<br>
				Jormund's shout has increased to level 2. <br>
			<p> Combat has ensued, beginning strong with a maelstrom of arrows. <br>
				The party attacks the 30 foot tall enemy, Ailis raining bullets into its body. <br>
				Combat ended in success. <br>
			<p> 
		<h3> 12/8/2018 </h3>
			<p> The motley crew engaged into a battle with EYEboi and HungerBOI. EYEboi was taken down fairly quickly, with HungerBOI taking a bit longer. <br>
				The fight culminated in HungerBOI eating EYEboi's corpse, then his own fists, and then bending backwards until there was an audible crack. Following the crack, he dissipated into dust.
			<p> Can't take a piss without a monster trying to eat its own ass. This is truly the life.
			<p> Upon ending the battle, the party went to discuss what to do next with Kalla Yellowmane. They are met with distrust and suspicion.
